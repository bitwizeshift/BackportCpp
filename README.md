**Backport** is an ongoing effort to bring modern C++ utilities to be compatible
with C++11.

It is a header-only library that implements much of the functionality from
C++14, C++17, and C++20 to be compatible with C++11. `constexpr` support is
conditionally enabled based on the language setting of the compiler (e.g.
if using C++14, more `constexpr` is available to the user than with C++11)

## Rationale

C++11 was release _9 years ago_, and yet many organizations still have yet to
move onto more modern releases. In some cases this is due to security reasons,
in others it may be that the toolchains don't yet exist for more modern C++
support. In any case, much of the newer C++ library types don't actually
require newer C++ language features -- but provide significant value to the
developer by creating a new vocabulary that doesn't exist in prior versions.

Much of the newer utilities may also have parallels in Boost libraries,
however many organizations are unable to adopt this -- either due to the domain
being too constrained, or due to Boost being a large dependency to introduce.

As a result, this library exists as a standalone, **header-only**,
dependency-free drop-in for newer standard library features from C++11, C++14,
C++17, and C++20.

## Features

### C++20

| Status | Feature                                                 | Paper(s)        |
|--------|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| ‚úÖ    | `bpstd::span`                                            | [`P0122R7`][01227]<br> [`P1024R3`][10243]<br> [`P1976R2`][19762]<br> [`P0317R1`][03171] |
| ‚úÖ    | `bpstd::to_address`                                      | [`P0653R2`][06532] |
| ‚úÖ (1) | `bpstd::make_unique_for_overwrite`                      | [`P1020R1`][10201]<br> [`P1973R1`][19731] |
| ‚úÖ     | `bpstd::is_nothrow_convertible`                         | [`P0758R1`][07581] |
1. The papers also include `make_shared_for_overwrite` and `allocate_shared_for_overwrite`,
   but these are intentionally not implemented -- since it is impossible to implement
   efficiently without also authoring `shared_ptr` (since to join the node allocations
   requires internal support)

## FAQ

### Where is `std::filesystem`?

This library aims to deliver a _header-only_ solution to the many missing
types that have been introduced in newer standard libraries. `std::filesystem`
is a bit complicated to handle, since it introduces a dependency on the
operating system being compiled against. Implementing `std::filesystem` will
generally require conditional compilation, and -- for best practices --
separate source files in order to insulate use of system headers (lest this
library introduce the perils of the `<windows.h>` macros). This would change the
library fundamentally so that it is no longer a header-only solution -- and this
is not desirable.

Third-party implementations of `std::filesystem` should exist, which can be
independently used.
